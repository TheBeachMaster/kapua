# JWT Security

To leverage JWT security features, a pair of RSA keys (a public one and a private one) must be loaded in Kapua.

## Use random generated keys

By default Kapua will look for keys in the path specified by `authentication.session.jwt.private.key` and `authentication.session.jwt.public.key` system properties at startup (see below). If such properties are not set Kapua will automatically generate new random private and public keys, while an error will be thrown if such files could not be found.

## Use custom keys

If you want to use custom keys you can generate an RSA key pair with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), and from that generate both the private and the public key. In order to create those files you can use the following commands:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out rsa-2048bit-key-pair.pem 2048
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform pem -in rsa-2048bit-key-pair.pem -outform pem -nocrypt -out private.key
openssl rsa -in rsa-2048bit-key-pair.pem -pubout -out public.key
```

Both keys MUST be in PEM PKCS8 non encrypted format (encrypted privte keys are currently not supported). 

Once created, the path must be specified in `authentication.session.jwt.private.key` and `authentication.session.jwt.public.key` system properties, either via -D startup parameter or by manually modifying `service/security/shiro/src/main/resources/kapua-authentication-setting.properties`.
